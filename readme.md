# üè° Tado Assistant

Enhance your Tado experience! Tado Assistant is a powerful utility that seamlessly interfaces with the Tado API, allowing you to monitor and adjust your home's state based on mobile device presence and open window detection in different zones.

## üöÄ Features

-   **State Monitoring**: Continuously logs the state of your home (HOME or AWAY).
-   **Smart Adjustments**: Detects discrepancies, such as no devices at home but the state is set to HOME, and adjusts accordingly.
-   **Open Window Detection**: Recognizes open windows in different zones and activates the appropriate mode.

## üõ† Prerequisites

-   A Unix-based system (Linux distributions or macOS).
- `git` installed to clone the repository.
-   Root or sudo privileges for the installation script.
-   `curl` and `jq` (Don't worry, our installer will help you set these up if they're not present).
-   Ensure both scripts (`install.sh` and `tado-assistant.sh`) reside in the same directory.

## üì• Installation

1.  Clone this repository to dive in:

    `git clone https://github.com/s1lviu/tado-assistant`

    `cd tado-assistant`

2.  Grant the installation script the necessary permissions:

    `chmod +x install.sh`

3.  Kick off the installation with root or sudo privileges:

    `sudo ./install.sh`


During the installation, the script will:

-   Set up the required dependencies.
-   Prompt you for your Tado credentials and other optional configurations.
-   Initialize `tado-assistant.sh` as a background service.

## üîß Configuration

Several environment variables drive the Tado Assistant:

-   `TADO_USERNAME`: Your Tado account username.
-   `TADO_PASSWORD`: Your Tado account password.
-   `CHECKING_INTERVAL`: Frequency (in seconds) for home state checks. Default is every 15 seconds.
-   `ENABLE_LOG`: Toggle logging. Values: `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.
-   `LOG_FILE`: Destination for the log file. Default is `/var/log/tado-assistant.log`.

These variables are stored in `/etc/tado-assistant.env`. Feel free to tweak them directly if needed.

## üîÑ Usage

After successfully installing the Tado Assistant, it will run silently in the background, ensuring your home's environment is always optimal. Here's how you can interact with it:

1. **Checking Service Status**:
   - **Linux**: `sudo systemctl status tado-assistant.service`
   - **macOS**: `launchctl list | grep com.user.tadoassistant`

2. **Manual Adjustments**: If you ever need to make manual adjustments to your Tado settings, simply use the Tado app. Tado Assistant will recognize these changes and adapt accordingly.

3. **Logs**: To understand what Tado Assistant is doing behind the scenes, refer to the logs. If logging is enabled, you can tail the log file for real-time updates:
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/tado-assistant.log
    ```

4. **Environment Variables**: To tweak the behavior of Tado Assistant, adjust the environment variables in `/etc/tado-assistant.env`. After making changes, restart the service for them to take effect.

Remember, Tado Assistant is designed to be hands-off. Once set up, it should require minimal interaction, letting you enjoy a comfortable home environment without any fuss.

## üìú Logs

If you've enabled logging (`ENABLE_LOG=true`), you can peek into the log file (default location: `/var/log/tado-assistant.log`) for real-time updates and messages.
## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

Currently, a dedicated uninstallation script is not provided. To manually uninstall:

1. Stop the service.
    - For Linux: `sudo systemctl stop tado-assistant.service`
    - For macOS: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.tadoassistant.plist`

2. Remove the service configuration.
    - For Linux: `sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/tado-assistant.service`
    - For macOS: `rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.tadoassistant.plist`

3. Remove the main script: `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/tado-assistant.sh`

4. Remove the environment variables file: `sudo rm /etc/tado-assistant.env`

5. Optionally, uninstall `curl` and `jq` if they were installed by the script and are no longer needed.
