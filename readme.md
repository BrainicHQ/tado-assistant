logos mentioned are the property of their respective owners. Please use this software responsibly and at your own risk.

## üõ† Prerequisites

- A Unix-based system (Linux distributions or macOS).
- `git` installed to clone the repository.
- Root or sudo privileges for the installation script.
- `curl` and `jq` (Don't worry, our installer will help you set these up if they're not present).
- Ensure both scripts (`install.sh` and `tado-assistant.sh`) reside in the same directory.

## üì• Installation

1. Clone this repository to dive in:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrainicHQ/tado-assistant.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd tado-assistant
   ```

2. Grant the installation script the necessary permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. Kick off the installation with root or sudo privileges:

   ```bash 
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

During the installation, the script will:

- Set up the required dependencies.
- Initiate a device code flow authentication for each Tado account:  
  You will be prompted to visit a verification URL and enter a user code in your browser. Once you complete this process, the installer automatically retrieves and stores a refresh token for each account.
- Configure additional settings, including setting the checking interval and the maximum duration for the 'Open Window' detection feature.
- Initialize `tado-assistant.sh` as a background service.
- Introduce a new configuration option for the 'Open Window' feature. You will be prompted to enter the maximum
  duration (in seconds) that the system should wait before resuming normal operation after an open window is detected.
  You can specify a custom duration or leave it empty to use the default duration set in the Tado app.

## üê≥ Docker Installation

Tado Assistant can now be run as a Docker container in interactive mode to accommodate the device code flow authentication.

1. **Pull the Docker Image:**
   Pull the latest version of Tado Assistant from Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker pull brainic/tado-assistant
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container in Interactive Mode:**

   This mode allows you to complete the device code flow authentication during container startup. Run the container with an interactive terminal:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name tado-assistant --restart=always -e NUM_ACCOUNTS=1 brainic/tado-assistant
   ```

   When running interactively, the container will prompt you to authenticate each Tado account via the device code flow. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Once the authentication and configuration are complete, you can detach from the container (using Ctrl+P followed by Ctrl+Q) or stop the container if needed.

3. **Docker Logs:**
   To check the logs of your Tado Assistant Docker container, use:

   ```bash
   docker logs tado-assistant
   ```

4. **Stopping and Removing the Container:**
   When you need to stop and remove the container, use the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker stop tado-assistant
   docker rm tado-assistant
   ```

This Docker setup offers a straightforward way to deploy Tado Assistant without the need for manual environment setup on
your host system.

## üîÑ Updating

To ensure you're running the latest version of Tado Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `tado-assistant` directory:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/tado-assistant
    ```

2. To update normally, run the installation script with the `--update` flag:

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh --update
    ```

   This will check for the latest version of the script, update any dependencies if necessary, and restart the service.

3. If you need to force an update (for instance, to revert local changes to the official version), use
   the `--force-update` flag:

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh --force-update
    ```

   This option will update Tado Assistant to the latest version from the repository, regardless of any local changes.
   It's useful for ensuring your script matches the official release.

### Note on Local Changes

- When updating, the script automatically detects and backs up any local modifications. These backups are stored as
  patch files, allowing you to restore your changes if needed.
- In case of conflicts during a normal update, the script will halt and prompt you to resolve these manually, ensuring
  your modifications are not unintentionally overwritten.

## üîß Configuration

Tado Assistant can be configured to handle multiple Tado accounts using a device code flow authentication mechanism. 
During installation, a refresh token is generated for each account. 
The following environment variables are stored in `/etc/tado-assistant.env`:

- `NUM_ACCOUNTS`: Number of Tado accounts you wish to manage. This should be set to the total number of accounts.

For each account (replace `n` with the account number, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...):

- `TADO_REFRESH_TOKEN_n`: The refresh token obtained via the device code flow authentication for the nth account.
- `CHECKING_INTERVAL_n`: Frequency (in seconds) for home state checks for the nth account. Default is every 15 seconds.
- `ENABLE_GEOFENCING_n`: Toggle geofencing check for the nth account. Values: `true` or `false`. Default is `true`.
- `ENABLE_LOG_n`: Toggle logging for the nth account. Values: `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.
- `LOG_FILE_n`: Destination for the log file for the nth account. Default is `/var/log/tado-assistant.log`.
- `MAX_OPEN_WINDOW_DURATION_n`: Define the maximum duration (in seconds) for the 'Open Window' detection feature to be
  active for the nth account. Leave this field empty to use the default duration set in the Tado app.

Feel free to tweak these variables directly if needed. Ensure to adjust the variable suffix `n` to match the corresponding account number.

## üîÑ Usage

After successfully installing the Tado Assistant, it will run silently in the background, ensuring your home's
environment is always optimal. Here's how you can interact with it:

1. **Checking Service Status**:
    - **Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status tado-assistant.service
    ``` 
    - **macOS**:
   ```bash
   launchctl list | grep com.user.tadoassistant
    ``` 

2. **Manual Adjustments**: If you ever need to make manual adjustments to your Tado settings, simply use the Tado app.
   Tado Assistant will recognize these changes and adapt accordingly.

3. **Logs**: To understand what Tado Assistant is doing behind the scenes, refer to the logs. If logging is enabled, you
   can tail the log file for real-time updates:
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/tado-assistant.log
    ```

4. **Adjusting 'Open Window' Duration**: The 'Open Window' detection feature's duration can be customized to suit your
   preferences. To modify this setting:
    - Edit the `/etc/tado-assistant.env` file.
    - Locate the `MAX_OPEN_WINDOW_DURATION` variable.
    - Set its value to the desired number of seconds. For example, `MAX_OPEN_WINDOW_DURATION=300` for a 5-minute
      duration.
    - Save the changes and restart the service for them to take effect.
        - For Linux:
          ```bash
          sudo systemctl restart tado-assistant.service
          ```
        - For macOS:
          ```bash
          launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.tadoassistant.plist
          launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.tadoassistant.plist
          ```
   This setting defines how long the system should wait before resuming normal operation after an open window is
   detected, allowing for energy-saving adjustments tailored to your needs.

Remember, Tado Assistant is designed to be hands-off. Once set up, it should require minimal interaction, letting you
enjoy a comfortable home environment without any fuss.
